TODO / Bugfixes
===============

## Questions

- why Krembot not designed as plugin like the other robots for argos?

## Insufficient documentation for user
- What is the pipeline for moving code to robots?
- Clear list of manual changes to be made when changing configs, source


## sourcing of setup.sh is added to bashrc multiple times with multiple installs
Need to check that it has not yet been added, or delete it from bashrc before adding it.
